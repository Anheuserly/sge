        <h2>Fire Detection</h2>
        <p>
            Fire detection is the cornerstone of any effective fire safety strategy. Advanced fire detection systems are designed 
            to detect the early signs of fire, whether it be smoke, heat, or gas leaks, and provide immediate alerts to initiate 
            a quick response. These systems can be tailored to various environments, from residential buildings to industrial 
            complexes, ensuring comprehensive protection against fire hazards.

        <h2>Automatic, Manual, and Wireless Fire Detection Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Our fire detection systems can be configured in multiple ways to suit different needs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Automatic Fire Detection Systems:</strong> These systems detect fire-related anomalies such as smoke or heat 
                and trigger an alarm without human intervention. They are essential for round-the-clock surveillance, providing 
                peace of mind even when the premises are unoccupied.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Manual Fire Detection Systems:</strong> Manual systems rely on human input to trigger an alarm, such as 
                pulling a fire alarm lever. They are ideal for areas where staff is present and can quickly respond to early signs 
                of a fire.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Wireless Fire Detection Systems:</strong> These systems offer flexibility and ease of installation, 
                especially in buildings where traditional wiring is challenging. Wireless systems use radio frequencies to 
                communicate between detectors and the control panel, ensuring reliable operation without the constraints of 
                wired connections.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Smoke, Heat, Beam, and Gas Detection Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Different fire detection systems are designed to detect various fire indicators, ensuring comprehensive protection 
            across all scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Smoke Detection:</strong> Smoke detectors are the most common type of fire detection device. They sense 
                the presence of smoke particles in the air, which are often the first signs of a fire. These detectors can be 
                optical (photoelectric) or ionization-based.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Heat Detection:</strong> Heat detectors are designed to respond to a rise in temperature. They are ideal 
                for environments where smoke detectors may cause false alarms, such as kitchens or garages.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Beam Detection:</strong> Beam detectors use infrared beams to detect smoke across large spaces, such as 
                warehouses or atriums. When smoke obstructs the beam, the system triggers an alarm.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>CO2 Detection:</strong> Carbon dioxide (CO2) detectors monitor the concentration of CO2 in the air. High 
                levels of CO2 can indicate a fire, especially in industrial environments where gas leaks might occur.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>LPG Detection:</strong> LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) detectors are crucial in areas where gas appliances 
                are used. They detect gas leaks that could lead to a fire or explosion, providing an early warning to prevent 
                disasters.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <section id="sprinkle-system">
        <h2>Sprinkle System</h2>
        <p>
            The Sprinkle System is a vital component of fire safety, designed to automatically respond to fire outbreaks. 
            This system is strategically installed across the ceiling of a building, ensuring optimal coverage. Each sprinkler 
            head is heat-sensitive, designed to activate when a certain temperature threshold is reached, releasing water to 
            extinguish the fire. The Sprinkle System provides a rapid response to fire incidents, significantly reducing the risk 
            of damage and protecting both property and lives. Whether it's a commercial complex, residential building, or 
            industrial facility, the Sprinkle System is an essential safeguard against the unpredictable nature of fire.
        </p>

    <section id="internal-external-hydrant-system">
        <h2>Internal/External Hydrant System</h2>
        <p>
            The Internal and External Hydrant System is a critical infrastructure in fire management. The internal hydrants are 
            strategically placed within buildings, while external hydrants are accessible outside. These systems are connected 
            to a reliable water source, providing firefighters with immediate access to water to fight fires. The hydrant system 
            is designed to deliver high-pressure water flow, ensuring that fire can be effectively suppressed before it spreads. 
            This system is indispensable in large buildings, factories, and public spaces, where quick and easy access to water 
            is crucial in an emergency.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High-pressure water delivery for effective fire suppression.</li>
            <li>Internal hydrants provide accessible points within buildings.</li>
            <li>External hydrants ensure rapid response from fire services.</li>
