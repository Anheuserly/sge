        <h2>Electrical Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Our comprehensive electrical services cover a wide range of critical infrastructure components that ensure reliable and efficient power 
            distribution for your projects.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Electrical Services Include:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>11 KV Transformer:</strong> We provide high-quality 11 KV transformers that are essential for stepping down high voltage electricity 
                to a usable level for industrial and commercial applications. These transformers ensure stable and efficient power supply.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>HT/LT Panel:</strong> Our HT (High Tension) and LT (Low Tension) panels are designed to manage and distribute electrical power 
                efficiently across various segments of your facility. These panels are critical for maintaining a steady power flow and protecting electrical equipment.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>HT/LT CB (Circuit Breaker):</strong> Our circuit breakers are crucial safety devices that automatically cut off the electrical supply 
                in case of overload or fault, protecting your equipment from damage and ensuring safety.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>HT/LT Bus Coupler Isolator:</strong> These devices are used to isolate electrical circuits for maintenance or in case of a fault, 
                providing flexibility and safety in the power distribution system.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Distribution Board Panel:</strong> We offer robust distribution boards that efficiently divide electrical power into subsidiary circuits 
                while providing a protective fuse or circuit breaker for each circuit in a common enclosure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>D G Set (Diesel Generator Set):</strong> Our DG sets provide reliable backup power during outages, ensuring that your operations can 
                continue uninterrupted in case of power failure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Internal Electrification:</strong> We specialize in the complete internal electrification of buildings, ensuring safe and efficient 
                distribution of power to all internal areas, including lighting, HVAC, and other electrical systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>External Electrification:</strong> Our external electrification services cover the installation and maintenance of power distribution 
                systems outside the building, including street lighting, outdoor power outlets, and other external electrical infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Power Cable Distribution:</strong> We handle the installation and management of power cable networks, ensuring efficient power 
                distribution across your facility with minimal loss and maximum safety.
            </li>
        </ul>
