        <h2>Fire Extinguishers</h2>
        <p>
            Fire extinguishers are essential tools in combating small fires before they escalate into uncontrollable blazes. 
            Different types of fire extinguishers are designed to tackle various classes of fires, ensuring that you have the 
            right equipment for every situation.

        <h3>Types of Fire Extinguishers:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Water Extinguishers:</strong> Water extinguishers are the most common type of fire extinguisher, 
                suitable for Class A fires, which involve solid combustibles like wood, paper, and textiles. They work by 
                cooling the burning material and soaking the flames to extinguish the fire effectively. However, they should 
                not be used on electrical fires or fires involving flammable liquids.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Foam Extinguishers:</strong> Foam extinguishers are versatile and effective against both Class A 
                and Class B fires, which involve flammable liquids such as petrol, oil, and solvents. The foam smothers 
                the fire, cutting off the oxygen supply and preventing re-ignition. They are safe for use on flammable 
                liquid fires and are also useful for fires involving solid materials.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Extinguishers:</strong> CO2 extinguishers are ideal for Class B fires 
                and electrical fires. They work by displacing the oxygen around the fire and cooling the flames. 
                Because CO2 extinguishers leave no residue, they are particularly suitable for use in areas with sensitive 
                electronic equipment, such as offices and server rooms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dry Powder Extinguishers:</strong> Also known as ABC extinguishers, dry powder extinguishers 
                are multi-purpose and can be used on Class A, B, and C fires, which involve flammable gases like propane and 
                butane. The powder works by smothering the flames and interrupting the chemical reaction, making these 
                extinguishers highly effective in a wide range of scenarios. However, they are not recommended for use in 
                enclosed spaces, as the powder can reduce visibility and cause breathing difficulties.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Wet Chemical Extinguishers:</strong> Wet chemical extinguishers are specifically designed for 
                Class F fires, which involve cooking oils and fats. The extinguisher releases a fine mist of chemicals 
                that cools the burning oil and creates a barrier between the fuel and the oxygen, effectively extinguishing 
                the fire and preventing re-ignition. These extinguishers are crucial in kitchens and food preparation areas.
