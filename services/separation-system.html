        <h2>Separation System</h2>
        <p>
            Our separation systems are designed to protect valuable assets and ensure the safety of personnel by providing advanced fire suppression solutions. 
            These systems are ideal for environments where water-based suppression might not be suitable, offering a variety of alternatives that ensure effective 
            fire control without causing water damage.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Separation Systems Include:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>FM-200 Waterless Fire Protection:</strong> The FM-200 system is a waterless fire suppression solution that discharges gas to extinguish fires 
                rapidly. It is particularly suitable for protecting sensitive electronics, data centers, and other environments where water damage could be detrimental.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>CO<sub>2</sub> Gas Flooding System:</strong> The CO<sub>2</sub> Gas Flooding System is a highly effective method for extinguishing fires in 
                enclosed spaces. It works by displacing oxygen, thereby suffocating the fire without leaving any residue, making it ideal for areas with delicate 
                machinery or equipment.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mechanical Foam Flooding System:</strong> The Mechanical Foam Flooding System utilizes foam to suppress fires, particularly those involving 
                flammable liquids. The foam creates a barrier that smothers the fire and prevents re-ignition, making it an excellent choice for industrial settings 
                and fuel storage areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Water Spray System:</strong> The Water Spray System is a specialized fire suppression system that uses a high-pressure water spray to control 
                and extinguish fires. It is particularly effective for cooling surfaces and controlling fires in environments where traditional sprinklers might not 
                be sufficient.
            </li>
